# Max Showroom Inventory Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes inventory and sales data from Max Showroom branches to identify sales trends, stock movement, and restocking requirements using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

The project combines analytical insights from a Jupyter Notebook with an interactive Streamlit dashboard to support data-driven inventory decisions.

## Problem Statement
Retail showrooms often face challenges such as:
- Overstocking low-demand products
- Stock shortages for high-demand items
- Limited visibility into branch-wise inventory performance

This project aims to analyze showroom inventory data to:
- Understand sales and demand patterns
- Analyze stock movement across branches and categories
- Support restocking decisions using data-driven logic

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset represents inventory and sales data from Max Showroom branches.

Key attributes include:
- Branch or Location
- Product Category and Brand
- Available Stock Quantity
- Sold Stock Quantity
- Price
- Seasonal Demand Indicator

Dataset file:
- Max Showroom Data.csv

---

## Data Analysis and Modeling
The analysis is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `Max_Inventory.ipynb` and includes:

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Branch-wise and category-wise stock analysis  
4. Demand and sales trend analysis  
5. Restocking decision logic  
6. Visualization of inventory metrics  

All notebook outputs are executed and saved for direct viewing on GitHub.
